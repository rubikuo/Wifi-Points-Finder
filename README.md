# Wifi Hotspot Finder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

# Why did we choose this problem and how we solve the problem?
For people who come to Helsingborg only for short time and do not have local phone service, or for those who don't have un-limited 4G internet on the phone, it can be inconvenient to go around the city without wifi.

As we know there are some places in town that provides free wifi, such as the train station or some coffee shops but not every place has public free wifi service. 
In fact, there are 203 free wifi hotspots in Helsingborg but we barely know where they are, even for the locals, so not to say those who visit Helsingborg for the first time.

Therefore, we would like to create a wifi hotspot finder application to provide users all the free wifi hotspot locations in Helsingborg to make the city a more "wifi-friendly"place.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
