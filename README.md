#Why we chose this problem and how we solve the problem?
For people who come to Helsingborg only for short time and do not have local phone service, or for those who don't have un-limited 4G internet on the phone, it can be inconvenient to go around the city without wifi.

As we know there are some places in town that provides free wifi, such as the train station or some coffee shops but not every place has public free wifi service. 
In fact, there are 203 free wifi hotspots in Helsingborg but we barely know where they are, even for the locals, so not to say those who visit Helsingborg for the first time.

Therefore, we would like to create a wifi hotspot finder application to provide users all the free wifi hotspot locations in Helsingborg to make the city a more "wifi-friendly"place.
